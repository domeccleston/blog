# Notes on Stubborn Attachments by Tyler Cowen

These were my main takeaways from Stubborn Attachments, available here at Stripe Press. They aren't
a complete summary of the book, just the parts I found most interesting.

## We underestimate the power of long-term economic growth

> We often forget how overwhelmingly positive the effects of economic growth have
> been. Economist Russ Roberts requently polls journalists about
> how much economic growth there has been since the year 1900. The typical response is that the standard of living has gone up by around fifty
> percent. __In reality, the U.S. standard of living has increased by a factor of
> five to seven__, estimated conservatively.

**Life in 1900**:
- 25% of US households had running water
- 12% had gas or electricity
- US High school graduation rate was 6%
- Typical US worker did 60 hour weeks at a physically arduous job
- Western European life expectancy was around 40 years

We have gained in leisure time, not just work. In 1880, individuals spent 80% of their discretionary time
working. Now we spend an average of 59% doing what we like.

## Tiny changes in the rate of economic growth produce vastly different outcomes

> Looking into the more distant future makes the question of the economic growth rate all the more important.
> For instance, a two percent rate of economic growth, as opposed to a one percent rate, makes only a small
> difference across the time horizon of a single year. But as time passes, the higher growth rate eventually
> brings about a very large boost to well-being. To make this concrete, here's an experiment: **redo U.S.
> history, but assume the country's economy had grown one percentage point less each year between 1870 and
> 1990. In that scenario, the United States of 1990 would be no richer than the Mexico of 1990**

## Money = log(happiness)

The most comprehensive study of the income-happiness link shows that the relationship
is roughly linear-log, implying that income boosts happiness even at higher levels of earnings. 

It's true that some older studies showed that income does not boost happiness further after a certain
level of wealth. These studies, which tended to rely on asking people questions about their happiness,
observed a 'hedonic treadmill' effect, where more wealth brought higher expectations, and less satisfaction.

But because these surveys rely on language, they miss the fact that our language around the term 'happiness'
is also subject to inflation. Someone in a Kenyan hospital might report that they are 'happy' with their
medical care, which in a sense is true: it meets their expectations. But despite that, they are subject to
real suffering in a way that they would not be if they were in a Western hospital.

Also, questionnaires suffer from selection bias: they don't include the people in poorer countries who
died from disease, hard labour, or poverty, poor countries would score much lower on questionnaires.

Wealth also serves as a cushion against very bad events at the societal level. 10 years ago, it was common
to argue that once a country attained the level of wealth found in Greece, happiness flatlined. Yet since then,
Greece has suffered an economic crisis, high unemployment, and this argument is no longer common.

Within a country, wealthy people report unambiguously higher levels of happiness than poorer people.

## Economic growth democratizes luxury goods

> Imagine that a time traveller paid a visit to Bill Gates today. He would find televisions, automobiles,
> refrigerators, central heating, antibiotics, plentiful food, flush toilets, cell phones, personal computers,
> and affordable air travel, among other remarkable benefits. The most impressive features of Gates's life,
> seen from the point of view of a person from the eighteenth century, are those shared by most citizens of
> wealthy countries today.

## Economic growth benefits poorer countries

There is an intution that rich countries harm poor countries, by absorbing investment and peopl from
them. But it's also true that those poorer countries benefit from the flow of more advanced technology from
richer countries. This is what enabled China's growth.

## Faith

The decisions we make about our GDP today affect the GDP of the world a thousand years down the line:
there is even research suggestions that the prosperity of a region well before 0BC strongly predicts its
prosperity today. Most of the benefits of economic growth today will be realized in the far future. 
How do we keep that future in mind?

> The actual attitudes required to induce an acceptance of such long time horizons are, in psychological
> terms, much closer to a kind of faith. We cannot see these very distant expected gains, but we must believe
> in them nonetheless, and we must hold those beliefs near and dear to our hearts. In this sense, we should
> strongly reject the modern secular tendency to claim that a good politics can or should be devoid of faith.

## Common-sense morality

Because of the importance of long-term growth, Tyler argues, it it is not necessary to reject 'common-sense
morality' in favour of redistributive utilitarianism a la Peter Singer:

> Most of us should work hard, be creative, be loyal to our civilization, build healthy institutions,
> save for the future, contribute to an atmosphere of social trust, be critical when necessary, and love
> our families. Our strongest obligations are to contribute to sustainable economic growth and to support
> the general spread of civilization, rather than to engage in massive charitable redistribution in the
> narrower sense. In the longer run, greater economic growth and a more stable civilization will help the
> poor most of all.
